**Introduction**


Our Chimp-test Puzzle would display a randomized sequence of 12 numbers on a single-digit 7-segment LED display at a challenging pace for each number. 


The player must then input the same sequence of numbers on a 4x4 digital keypad to solve the puzzle. 


If the playerâ€™s inputs exactly match the order of numbers that was previously shown within a given time, multi-color LEDs will blink green to indicate the player has successfully completed the puzzle. 


If the player fails to input the correct sequence of numbers or runs out of time, all multi-color LEDs will display red for 3 seconds to indicate the player has failed the puzzle.
